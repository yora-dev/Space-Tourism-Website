## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **building multipage websites** with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  
I learned how to:

- Implement tab navigation to dynamically update content
- Create a responsive layout that works on multiple screen sizes
- Use **Styled Components** for theming and modular CSS
- Combine **Flexbox and CSS Grid** for complex layouts

### Continued development

**In the future, I’d like to:**

- Improve animations and transitions for tab content and hover effects
- Explore advanced routing with Next.js for smoother page transitions
- Implement a dark mode toggle across all pages

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid
